The Singularity operates on a principle of 'Radical Self Reliance' which is to say that ultimately individuals are 
repsonsible for their own happiness and setting up whatever infrastructure they need for this. 

That said a number
of facilities exist in The Singularity to assist. 

Near the front gate is a visitor center where people can learn about The Singularity, watch short videos, and possibly 
go for a tour. There is also a cafe 

There will be several shower & toilet facilities around the campus so people can relieve themselves with ease.

We'll have a kitchen set up that prepares meals for participants on a meal plan.

There will be a large coworking space with electricity & internet where people can sit study and work quietly. 
The cafe and small nooks around the campus provide space for socializing and meetings.

Drinking water and water for bathing and washing clothes will also be available.

Camping space is available to everyone. People need to provide their own tents and create their own shade and 
hang out places.
