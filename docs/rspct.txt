The Singularity operates on a quarterly schedule. Near the end of each quarter we conduct a demo day called RSPCT 
in which camps are encouraged to recognize the achievements of their members and individuals show off what they've 
been working on during the quarter. RSPCT is also for people & camps to talk about and gather support for  their plans 
for the upcoming quarter.
